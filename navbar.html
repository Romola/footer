				<p>Chip and Dale (also rendered as Chip 'n' Dale or Chip an' Dale) are two chipmunk cartoon characters created at Walt Disney Productions in 1943. Their names are a pun based on the name of the famous 18th-century cabinet maker and furniture designer Thomas Chippendale. This was suggested by Bill "Tex" Henson, a story artist at the studio.Of the two, Chip is portrayed as being safe, focused, and having a mind for logical scheming. Dale, by contrast, is more goofy, dim-witted and impulsive, and has a very strong sense of humor. Originally the two had a very similar appearance, but as a way to tell them apart, some differences were introduced: Chip has a small black nose (which somewhat resembles a chocolate "chip", as befitting his name) and two centered protruding teeth, whereas Dale has a large dark red nose and his prominent canine teeth showing. Chip is also depicted as having smooth hair on top of his head while Dale's tends to be ruffled.In most cartoons they are antagonists against Pluto, Mickey Mouse, or most often, against Donald Duck. In the 1950s, they were given their own series, but only three cartoons resulted under their name: Chicken in the Rough (1951), Two Chips and a Miss (1952) and The Lone Chipmunks (1954).

				<p>Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.Donald Duck rose to fame with his comedic roles in animated cartoons. Donald's first appearance was in 1934 in The Wise Little Hen, but it was his second appearance in Orphan's Benefit which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse. Donald Duck's name may have been inspired by Australian cricket legend Donald Bradman. In 1932 Bradman and the Australian team were touring North America and he made the news after being dismissed for a duck against New York West Indians.
